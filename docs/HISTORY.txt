    - Plone 4 compatibility - leadimage scale must be stored in
      plone.app.imaging properties.

1.1.7 - 2009/09/22

      meanwhile.

    - fixed spelling

1.1.3 - 2008/10/14

    - be more careful when accessing cli_properties property sheet in schema
      extender. It may be called too soon and cause AttributeError.

    - added uninstall code which removes configlet

1.1.2 - 2008/10/10

    - make lead image field language dependent. This fixes problem with
      Linguaplone and it helps to make multi language screenshots, for example.

1.1.1 - 2008/10/10

    - fixed body viewlet - image tag was there even if there was no image

    - fixed potential error when object schema has no 'description' field.

1.1 - 2008/09/23

    - moved integer and string properties from propertiestool.xml to
      setuphandlers, because properties were overriden with default
      values on reinstall.

    - removed max size settings from the controlpanel and reuse max_size from
      ATContentTypes settings (zconf.ATNewsItem.max_image_dimension)

    - images may be captioned

    - if image is displayed in the body, it is possible to display image
      fullscreen (the same as newsitem image)

    - it is possible to specify, which scale will be used for displaying the
      image in "description" part and which in "body" part.

    - make images "newsitem" like. Image tags uses the same CSS classes as
      news items, leadImage field uses the same scales as News Item plus one
      special 'leadimage' scale defined by user in the controlpanel.

    - it is possible to set allowed_types. Document and Folder are allowed
      by default.

    - changed CSS - define float on the leadimage-wrapper to easily
      style leadimage itself (for example for adding border around the image)

    - fixed dependency on plone.browserlayer

    - make extender browser layer aware

      rewritten using archetypes.schemaextender. If you upgrade from
      version <1.0 please don't forget to run upgrade step from
      portal_setup/Upgrades, choose the collective.contentleadimage profile,
      check the (0.3 - 1.0) upgrade step and press Upgrade button.

    - it is possible to specify maxwidth and maxheight in the controlpanel
      [naro]

    - created new viewlet in AboveContentBody viewlet manager. This viewlet
      displays large version of the image (size specified as maxwidth/maxheight
      in the controlpanel). It is possible to switch on/off both viewlets
      in @@manage-viewlets or in leadimage control panel.
      [naro]
